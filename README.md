# Paradiddle Workshop
Base project to create mods for Paradiddle. Includes an example mod.

## Description
This project was created to allow the Paradiddle Community to create mods to enhance their experience. We did our best to offer complete creative freedom with the least amount of constraints possible. With access to main features of the app, possible mod functonalities include but definitely are note limited to:
* Creating custom drums, that support multiple hit zones to make different voices
* Overriding the visuals of highway tracks and notes
* A new highway system
* New Environments
* Interactable Items, Props, FX
* Minigames to be played with drums
* Override Stick and Headset Visuals
